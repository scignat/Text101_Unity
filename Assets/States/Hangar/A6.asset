  storyText: "A6. Dark Room\r\n\nRight, well, that took far longer than anticipated
    but the lock is off and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station
    being so loud. \r\n\r\nYou're in a dark room. You hear people yelling over the
    top of the combustion boilers. You catch some words. THUNK, THUNK, \"shut off
    the valves...\", THUNK THUNK, \"...get out in time?\", THUNK THUNK, \"...massive
    pressure\", THUNK THUNK \"...for glory\"... THUNK THUNK...\r\n\r\nWhat next, Adventurer?\r\n\r\n1.
    Get closer to the people speaking.\r\n2. Ignore them, keep pushing for the airship."
